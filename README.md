I am a university mathematics student currently obsessed with the intersection of stochastic calculus, algorithmic logic, and market dynamics.
This repository serves as my laboratory where I translate abstract mathematical theories into functional code.
My ultimate objective is to evolve into a Quantitative Researcher, though I am fully aware that I am currently at the "Hello World" stage of this complex journey.


The Current Lab: Paper Trading Simulator:

The core project in this repo is a basic Market Simulator built in Python. Unlike static tutorials, I have focused on creating a dynamic loop where prices fluctuate using random walks.
I have implemented a manual command-line interface to simulate the pressure of decision-making and used Matplotlib to visualize the cold reality of net worth evolution.
